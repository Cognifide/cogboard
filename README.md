Cogboard helps you create dashboards for your project needs.

Information is a key to success, with Cogboard you can gather all the information about project in one place. Cogboard lets you present data from external sources like Jenkins, Bamboo, SonarQube, share important links or check if crucial endpoints are still available. All of this in friendly, easy to configure and deploy package.

We designed Cogboard with these principles in mind:

Easy to use - comes with a set of ready to use Widgets that can be configured in Web browser.

Easy to deploy - works on any machine with Docker CE and JVM.

Easy to extend - creating new Widget is simple.

Secure - all integrations are done on backend.
